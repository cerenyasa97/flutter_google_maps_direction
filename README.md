## Description
Map methods were coded with Flutter and Google Maps API. Places API is used for autocomplete in address search. The predicted addresses are shown as a list for the user to choose. After the user determines the destination, a route is drawn with the "Draw Route" button. With the "Home" and "Work" buttons, the home and work locations that are statically given are displayed to the user.
